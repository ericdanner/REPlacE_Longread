# This is the actual data after being sorted and processed by the python scripts and what is used in the paper.

# however, the one change is that the deletion files were too large so I cut them down to the first 40000 lines (~1000 reads) to keep it small enough for github
# but the rest can be analyzed with R script just the same as before or with the plotting in python to generate the fwd/rev orientation quantification
