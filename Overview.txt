#THIS IS ALL WRITTEN VERY MESSY. In general most of the work is in the Jupyter notebooks in 'scripts'. Then the other major step is the R script in "analysis"
# please contact edanner.lab@gmail.com for help making sense of it.

#Install miniconda
#Install the .yml conda enviornment Danner. It has the required software for the alignments.
#Install IGV for easily viewing alignments
#Install Rstudio with:
	library(data.table)
	library(GenomicAlignments)
	library(seqinr)

#Load JuptyerNotebooks from the Danner.yml conda enviornment

RawData -> SeqFwd -> Sortedseq -> Alignmnet(minimap or BBmap) -> Analysis (indel analysis) Use R script to analyze indels. -> Plot


# There is just some sample unsorted data that is the first 1000 fastq files.
# The sorted data file has the sorted data acutally used in the paper, except the sorted deletion reads were truncated as the original fasta file was too big for github.
